unity-tweak-tool Is Awesome! I came to know that there was already a short cut key `Super+s` and `Super+w` for spreading the desktops and spreading the windows respectively! I even activated a `hot corner` at the bottom to spread the windows in the current desktop.

`sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool`

###Hints for writing the deploy.prototxt
```
To write a deploy.prototxt, copy this to a new file called deploy.prototxt in

name: "<the name in the train_val.prototxt>"
input: "data"
input_dim: 10
input_dim: 3
input_dim: 224 # or whatever the crop_size is in train_val.prototxt
input_dim: 224

Append to that all layers in train_val.prototxt.
Delete the first few layers that don't have a "bottom" field.
Delete all paramaters that have to do exclusively with learning.
e.g.:

    blobs_lr
    weight_decay
    weight_filler
    bias_filler

Change the value of the layer that contains a "num_output" field
to the number of categories.
```
