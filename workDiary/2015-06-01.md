Reverted back to Nvidia driver 331.xx from the Ubuntu 14.04 repository. 
did `sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit` which installed CUDA 5.5. 
Checked `nvcc -V` the version was 5.5. (CUDA 6.5 is still installed).
Tried to compile and run some CUDA code to see if the CUDA 5.5 works fine. But it was taking time.

 After reading for a while, I figured out that what I want is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or the new LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) RNN.
Was looking around for a good place to actually start coding a Deep learning NN. Found some good stuffs:

2. <http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/>
