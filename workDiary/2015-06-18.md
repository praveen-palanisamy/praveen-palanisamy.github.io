===========================

Modified the googleNet to use the Yale pubfig database as in Experiment1. This time I had to set the image sizes to 224x224 as 40x40 gave error as the googleNet layers were designed to work for 224x224 images. 
Started training the Net! Let's see what happens. The experiment files and scripts are at :
```bash 
/home/praveen/Copy/DiscoveryRobotics/deepLearning/workbench/face-classification/Experiment2/
```

I used the default batch size of 128 and my GPU went out of memory:

```

Will reduce the batch size to 64 but before that I will run it again and do`watch nvidia-smi`
to see what it reports!

=======================
Could get it to run only at a batch size of 8!
The temperature is now (87) better compared to 98 degree celsius! I elevated my laptop to allow the exhaust vents to have some space in 3D.
