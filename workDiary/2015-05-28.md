Installed the nvidia 352.09 driver from xorg-edgers repository as the one with the 14.04 repository is 331 and the CUDA 6.5 samples (CUDA was installed by the Jetpack or may be I installed it) reported error something like driver not sufficient for CUDA run time.

I realised that eh GT 750M on my dell laptop has **384** CUDA cores compared to Jetson's 192.

Caffe installation:<http://jetsonhacks.com/2015/01/20/nvidia-jetson-tk1-cudnn-install-caffe-example/>

Compiling Cafee on the Jetson. The dev branch's code had some issues. The master branch seems fine so far! I am using cuDNN v2.
