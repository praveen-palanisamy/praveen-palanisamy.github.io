I encountered the same error as in this thread of Caffe users: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/caffe-users/LsGWEdeTPlw>

* I did `grep -rnw "caffe/" -e "-lpython2"` got occurrences of `-lpython2.7` and one black sheep `-lpython2`. 
* I then edited that particular cmake generated file to read `-lpython2.7` instead of `-lpython2`. 
* I then ran `make -j4`. Same error. 
* I removed the CmakeCache.txt (forgot the upper/lower case. Filename could be different).
* Again, `make -j4`
