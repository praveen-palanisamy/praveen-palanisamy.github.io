==========================

Started training the Caffe net using the Yale pubfig face database.
The `solver.prototxt` used is:
```
# The training protocol buffer definition
train_net: "face_train.prototxt"
# The testing protocol buffer definition
test_net: "face_test.prototxt"
# test_iter specifies how many forward passes the test should carry out.
# In the case of MNIST, we have test batch size 100 and 100 test iterations,
# covering the full 10,000 testing images.
test_iter: 100
# Carry out testing every 500 training iterations.
test_interval: 500
# The base learning rate, momentum and the weight decay of the network.
base_lr: 0.01
momentum: 0.9
weight_decay: 0.0005
# The learning rate policy
lr_policy: "inv"
gamma: 0.0001
power: 0.75
# Display every 100 iterations
display: 100
# The maximum number of iterations
max_iter: 100000
# snapshot intermediate results
snapshot: 10000
snapshot_prefix: "face"
# solver mode: CPU or GPU
solver_mode: GPU
```

My bad: Didn't even try to change the comments or params. This is my first hands-on training of Caffe net. Wanted to check/see how long the training takes. Have roughly about 30K face images resized to 40x40.
**3267 test images**, **27490 train images**

It completed! The last few lines:

Moved all the generated files (caffemodel and solverstate) to the folder **Experiment 1**

===========================

Planning to re-run another Experiment using preprocessing with:
* Face frontalization if possible
* Tan-triggs illumination pre-processing
