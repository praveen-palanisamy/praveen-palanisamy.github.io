============================

The python script to pull the images from the pubFig DB `eval_urls.txt` was still running after I resumed from the Hibernate!

=========================

Checked out dlib library. 
Especially this example:
```
praveen@praveen-Inspiron-7537:~/programs/dlib-18.16/examples/build$ ./face_landmark_detection_ex shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat ../faces/*.jpg
```
The results are good. I could use this for face detection/collection and a face normalizing algorithm before training a neural net.

================================

Compiling the sirius application.
`./compile-sirius-servers.sh`

 Landed with a problem: **NVCC fatal compute_13 not supported** it was pointing to the Makefile of cudmatrix in Kaldi where the default CUDA flags were `-generate arch=computer_13 code=sm_13` and then new flags were added according to the detected CUDA version. I removed that line `-generate arch=computer_13 code=sm_13` and then Kaldi got compiled. 
 **NOTE:** I went into the cudmatrix dir, did make and then did make at the source root dir. 

 The next problem came while compiling   `detect.cpp` in the image matching module. 
 Lots of errors starting with:
 ```
 /usr/local/include/opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp:73:21: error: ‘vector’ has not been declared                      vector<KeyPoint>& keypoints) const;
 ```
I did not compile the non-free modules when I buil the OpenCV3.0 library. Also, the non-free modules are available under a different src tree here :<https://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib/>

Re-building OpenCV3.0 with the nonfree modules. But I am expecting quite a few modifications to Sirius's image matching (at least detect.cpp).

 Re-built OpenCV3 with the contrib modules which includes the SIFT and other non-free stuffs.
 Got errors starting with 
```
  /usr/local/include/opencv2/gpu/gpu.hpp:432:29: error: ‘vector’ does not name a type
```

I added `using namespace std;` before `#include "opencv2/gpu/gpu.hpp" ` which solved that error.

Editing detect.cpp taking into consideration the OpenCV2-->OpenCV3 transition guide <http://docs.opencv.org/master/db/dfa/tutorial_transition_guide.html>

* replaced `gpu::` with `cuda::`
* replaced gpu::FAST_GPU -> cv::cuda::FastFeatureDetector
* Refer to <https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/samples/gpu/performance/tests.cpp> for the correct usage of cuda::FastFeatureDetector
