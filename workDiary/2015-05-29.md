=================================

It's about lunch time. Friday review lunch! 

"I am working on the high level architecture of the Receptionist Robot. I was looking into existing systems which offer similar capabilities. Most of them use traditional methods wherein the system has a fixed knowledge. The robot is only as wise as it was once programmed to be. So, I was evaluating the option of using a Deep learning neural network for the robot by which the robot can update its knowledge base on its own without requiring new code.
 This week, I was mainly working on setting up the infrastructure on the GPU to start a deep learning neural network. There were issues in getting the GPU drivers and the CUDA libraries installed and working properly. yesterday, I managed to solve them all and compiled everything successfully for the Jetson. I am facing few minor issues with the CUDA cross compiler on my laptop which I plan to solve by today.  "

=======================

Still the problem with the CUDA+ NVIDIA drivers on my laptop aren't solved. 

**Here's all that happened with the CUDA failure so far**

I installed the Nvidia JetPackTK1-1.1 which installed _cudal4t_and other tegra optimized libraries for the Jetson. It also instlaled the _Visual profiler_ and _Nsight eclipse IDE_ But I don't think it installed CUDA for my x86_64 laptop. Maybe I had installed CUDA 6.5 on my laptop a while ago. I was using the nvidia 331 drivers from the ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04) repositories which were "tested". The _deviceQuery_ sample failed to run saying "Insufficient driver version for the CUDA run time" (cudart). The _deviceQueryDry_ also didn't run successfully saying "No Cuda capable device found" whaat?!

I tried the driver version 340 from the CUDA 6.5 SDK from the nvidia downloads (CUDA 7 is the latest at the moment so CUDA 6.5 was an old version). I then re-compiled the CUDA samples (if that actually helped). Even then I got similar errors from the _deviceQuery_ and _deviceQUeryDry_ examples that the driver version was insufficient. 

I tried updating the Nvidia drivers by adding the **ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa**. I installed the driver version 350.xx (it said it was opensource). Although the reboot was successful and unlike my previous tries, I had a normal desktop (and not a blank desktop). But Ubuntu became unresponsive a couple of time and so I decided to roll back to the driver version 331 which was proprietary but was tested and I found it to be working. 

So then I decided to do a clean install of CUDA SDK using the official guide at <http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/>
I found that I didn't have to uninstall the previous CUDA installation for my configuration. The guide is well written. It installed the 340.29 driver, the CUDA 6.5.12 and the samples. This time, _deviceQuery_ and _deviceQueryDry_ came up with a new error.

```
But this error is little more informative as it says it cannot insert the **nvidia_331_uvm** kernel driver module.

================================
I was wondering why it is complaining about **nvidia_331_uvm** when the driver 440.29 is installed. I then found out that the nvidia sourcce for the uvm and the driver is available at **/usr/src/nvidia-340.29/** all other versions are available under **/usr/src/nvidiaxx**. I did `cd uvm` then I did `sudo make` it said

``` 
praveen@praveen-Inspiron-7537:/usr/src/nvidia-340.29/uvm$ sudo make
cd ./..; make module SYSSRC=/lib/modules/3.13.0-53-generic-tuxonice/build SYSOUT=/lib/modules/3.13.0-53-generic-tuxonice/build KBUILD_EXTMOD=./..

```
So then I went into the src directory of the current kernel which was at `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-53-generic-tuxonice` Yes! I am using tuxonice's patched kernel to be able to hibernate using the hibernate-disk (s2disk).

I ran `sudo make oldconfig` which generated the config files but ` sudo make prepare` didn't work and was complaining. `sudo make` said `no rule to make target /arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl`  
After search around the globe, (yeah google), I again did `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa` (I had purged it when 350.xx driver didn't work well). Then I did `sudo apt-get install nvidia-340-uvm`

Everything went well like this:

```

Rebooting to see if that helps...

Didn't help :/. Now the plan is to downgrade. I am planning to settle with the 331 Nvidia drivers and the CUDA 5.5 from the Ubuntu 14.04 repositories.
