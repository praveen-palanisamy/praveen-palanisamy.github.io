  title: "[Patent]Spatial and temporal attention-based deep reinforcement learning of hierarchical lane-change policies for controlling an autonomous vehicle"
  img: spatio-temporal-attention-hdrl-768x662.png
  description: "Performing safe and efficient lane changes is a crucial feature for creating fully autonomous vehicles. Recent advances have demonstrated successful lane following behavior using deep reinforcement learning, yet the interactions with other vehicles on road for lane changes are rarely considered. Systems and methods are provided that employ spatial and temporal attention-based deep reinforcement learning of hierarchical lane-change policies for controlling an autonomous vehicle. An actor-critic network architecture includes an actor network that process image data received from an environment to learn the lane-change policies as a set of hierarchical actions, and a critic network that evaluates the lane-change policies to calculate loss and gradients to predict an action-value function (Q) that is used to drive learning and update parameters of the lane-change policies. The actor-critic network architecture implements a spatial attention module to select relevant regions in the image data that are of importance, and a temporal attention module to learn temporal attention weights to be applied to past frames of image data to indicate relative importance in deciding which lane-change policy to select."

  description: "It was an invaluable CES 2020 experience as a part of Microsoft’s Autonomous Systems group collaborating with Bell Helicopter (https://lnkd.in/eGqndv9) in the showcase of Bell’s AerOS’s capabilities with a fully operational demo using scaled-down Nexus 4EX (https://lnkd.in/enJ5W5F) in a smart city. While it’s far from perfect, just seeing the TOL (Take-Off-Landing) and the NAV (Navigation) “Brains”, (providing an autonomous visual guidance system as a backup) deployed onto Bell’s drones that were demoed to the 150k+ CES audience was rewarding for me after months of hard-work on the AI pipeline. Thanks to Microsoft and Bell for providing the opportunity. This was my shortest development-to-deployment/production cycle of an autonomous (sub)system till date that was demoed publicly on the target hardware/robot!"

  description: "The capability to learn and adapt to changes in the driving environment is crucial fordeveloping autonomous driving systems that are scalable beyond geo-fenced oper-ational design domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promisingand scalable framework for developing adaptive learning based solutions. Deep RLmethods usually model the problem as a (Partially Observable) Markov DecisionProcess in which an agent acts in a stationary environment to learn an optimalbehavior policy. However, driving involves complex interaction between multiple,intelligent (artificial or human) agents in a highly non-stationary environment. Inthis paper, we propose the use of Partially Observable Markov Games(POSG) forformulating the connected autonomous driving problems with realistic assumptions.We provide a taxonomy of multi-agent learning environments based on the natureof tasks, nature of agents and the nature of the environment to help in categorizingvarious autonomous driving problems that can be addressed under the proposedformulation. As our main contributions, we provide MACAD-Gym, a Multi-AgentConnected, Autonomous Driving agent learning platform for furthering research inthis direction. Our MACAD-Gym platform provides an extensible set of ConnectedAutonomous Driving (CAD) simulation environments that enable the research anddevelopment of Deep RL- based integrated sensing, perception, planning andcontrol algorithms for CAD systems with unlimited operational design domainunder realistic, multi-agent settings. We also share the MACAD-Agents that weretrained successfully using the MACAD-Gym platform to learn control policies formultiple vehicle agents in a partially observable, stop-sign controlled, 3-way urbanintersection environment with raw (camera) sensor observations.
