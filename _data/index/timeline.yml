  title: "[Patent]Spatial and temporal attention-based deep reinforcement learning of hierarchical lane-change policies for controlling an autonomous vehicle"

  description: "Performing safe and efficient lane changes is a crucial feature for creating fully autonomous vehicles. Recent advances have demonstrated successful lane following behavior using deep reinforcement learning, yet the interactions with other vehicles on road for lane changes are rarely considered. Systems and methods are provided that employ spatial and temporal attention-based deep reinforcement learning of hierarchical lane-change policies for controlling an autonomous vehicle. An actor-critic network architecture includes an actor network that process image data received from an environment to learn the lane-change policies as a set of hierarchical actions, and a critic network that evaluates the lane-change policies to calculate loss and gradients to predict an action-value function (Q) that is used to drive learning and update parameters of the lane-change policies. The actor-critic network architecture implements a spatial attention module to select relevant regions in the image data that are of importance, and a temporal attention module to learn temporal attention weights to be applied to past frames of image data to indicate relative importance in deciding which lane-change policy to select."
