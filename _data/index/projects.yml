  desc: Cross-platform Memory and Retrieval-Augmented Finder (File Explorer) App to chat with your data to find answers powered by **OpenAI-GPT/Llama2/Transformer.js models**. You can load multiple DOCX, PDF, CSV, Markdown, HTML or other files and ask questions related to their content, and the app will use embeddings and LLMs to generate answers from the most relevant files and sections within your files. Leverages **Vector DB for persistant Memory & Chats**, supports **asyncrhonous LLM streaming Ops** and **Conversation Orchestration**. See project page for more details and how you can run or deploy on your own machine, cloud or hybrid environments.

  repo: Tensorflow-2-Reinforcement-Learning-Cookbook
  img: tf2rl-cookbook.png
  desc: This book contains easy-to-follow recipes for leveraging **TensorFlow 2.x** to develop artificial intelligence applications. Starting with an introduction to the fundamentals of **deep reinforcement learning** and TensorFlow 2.x, the book covers **OpenAI Gym**, **model-based RL**, **model-free RL**, and how to develop basic agents. You'll discover how to implement advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as **actor-critic**, **deep deterministic policy gradients**, **deep-Q networks**, **proximal policy optimization**, and **deep recurrent Q-networks** for training your RL agents. As you advance, youâ€™ll explore the applications of reinforcement learning by building **cryptocurrency trading agents**, **stock/share trading agents**, and intelligent **agents for automating task completion**. Finally, you'll find out how to **deploy deep reinforcement learning agents to the cloud** and **build cross-platform apps** using TensorFlow 2.x.
