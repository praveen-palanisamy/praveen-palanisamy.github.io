## Patent Numbers

At each step of the patent process, there is an unique number to identify the document.

The **Patent Application Number** is the number that is assigned to the patent application when it is filed.  
The **Patent Publication Number** is the number that is assigned to the patent application when it is published.  
The **Patent (Grant) Number** is the number that is assigned to the patent after it is granted.

The relationship between these numbers can vary by country. For example, an application publication number and a grant publication number may be the same in some countries (such as with EP applications), since the kind code uniquely distinguishes them. They may also be different (such as with US applications).

In the United States, a publication number includes a four-digit year, followed by a seven-digit sequence code followed by a two-character Kind Code that is assigned by the USPTO. The Kind Code is used to distinguish between different types of publications, such as applications, granted patents, and reissues. For example, a US patent application publication number is 2019/0123456 A1, and a US patent grant publication number is 10,123,456 B2. The application publication number and the grant publication number are different, but the patent number is the same.

Example:

Patent Application Number: US 16/048,144  
Patent Publication Number: US 2020/0033868 A1  
Patent Grant Number: US 10,845,815 B2 ==> 10,845,815 is the patent number

The patent publication numbers follow this format: country code, a number, and a kind code

**Kind code** : version numbers for published versions of the patent application.  
Every country has their own set of kind codes, but typically an A code (such as A1) represents a patent application, and a B code (such as B2) represents a granted patent

**Notes**:

- The Patent Application number and the Publication numbers are related to the Patent Application. These numbers are not directly related to the Granted Patent number.
