## Outer space energy generation, compute clusters, cold-data storage

#### What?

Generate electricity on moons and/or other planets to reduce resource exploitation and fossil fuel emissions on earth to meet human needs of the present and the future.
Utilize the generated electricity to:

- Power space exploration vehicles
- Satellites and other man-made space orbitting objects
- Run large-scale computing workloads (like protein folding/synthesis) or store/preserve zeta-bytes of digital data generated on earth in data centers.
- Run quantum computers
  - Requires extreme/low, regulated temperatures)
  - Need to avoid radiations like Gamma
  - [QTSPACE initiative](https://www.qtspace.eu/)
- Beam it back to earth to solve energy crisis!

#### Why?

Clean energy generation using nuclear fusion/fission is a possibility in outer space while prohibitive on earth

- E.g.: Use the non-radio-active helium3, available on the moon to genearte nuclear energy.

#### How?

- Use a combination of teleoperation, robotics and autonomous systems to operate the power plants to generate energy including nuclear fusion/fission
