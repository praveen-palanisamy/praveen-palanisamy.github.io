[Distillation-of-past-thoughts draft.]

Open source software has generated a lot of value for the world. It has also generated a lot of value for the companies that have built their businesses on top of open source software. Yet, the value captured by the open source software community is still very small compared to the value generated by the open source software community.
More than 90% of companies use open source ([State of Open report by open UK](https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openuk-state-of-open_final-version.pdf)). Open-source software is the foundation of 99% of the world's software ([GitHub Octoverse report Oct, 2022](https://octoverse.github.com/), [Venturebeat article](https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/github-releases-open-source-report-octoverse-2022-says-97-of-apps-use-oss/)).
